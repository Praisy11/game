# Clicky-Game
The Clicky Game App, is a memory game app build with React. This app will break your application's UI into components, manage component state, and respond to user events.
# How the App works
-A new React application using Create React App.

-The application will render different images (of your choice) to the screen. Each image will listen for click events.

-The application will keep track of the user's score. The user's score will be incremented when clicking an image for the first time. The user's score will be reset to 0 if they click the same image more than once.

-Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page will shuffle themselves in a random order.

-Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game will restart.
